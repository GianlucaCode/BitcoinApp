# BitcoinApp
This is a hybrid mobile app built with the Ionic framework. It leverages the Bitcoin Average API and the Highcharts charting library to display a list of Bitcoin currency exchange rates and their pricing history.

## Running the App
First, make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, open up your terminal and run the following command to install Cordova and Ionic:

<code>npm install -g cordova ionic

Now, simply cd into the downloaded folder and start up the server:

<code>ionic serve --lab
